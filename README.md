Sure! Here's a README file you can use for your mini calculator code:

# Mini Calculator

A simple Python program that takes two numbers as input and performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- Accepts decimal numbers as input.
- Calculates and displays the sum, difference, product, and quotient.
- Easy to understand, beginner-friendly code with fun comments.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. When prompted, enter the first number (decimals allowed).
3. Enter the second number.
4. The program will display the results of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing the two numbers.

## Example

```
Enter the first number: 10.5
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.5
Difference: 8.5
Product: 21.0
Quotient: 5.25
```

## Notes

- The program assumes the second number is not zero to avoid division by zero errors.
- Feel free to extend the program with error handling or more operations!

## Code Snippet

```python
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

sum_result = num1 + num2
difference_result = num1 - num2
product_result = num1 * num2
quotient_result = num1 / num2  # Make sure num2 != 0!

print(f"Results of your two numbers:")
print(f"Sum: {sum_result}")
print(f"Difference: {difference_result}")
print(f"Product: {product_result}")
print(f"Quotient: {quotient_result}")
```
